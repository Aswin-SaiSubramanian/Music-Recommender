Things to Download:
- MSD Allmusic Genre Dataset (MAGD) - These are the labels that we will use to sort. Download from: Download genre classifications at http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/mir/msd/download.html#groundtruth
- MSD Sample Subset (10000 samples) - These are the tracks we will be using for training and testing. Download from: http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/getting-dataset/

Steps:
1. Take all of the tracks out of their subdirectories and into a single folder.
	1.1) To do this, we will be going into the linux terminal. Run the following, replacing "SRC_DIR" and "DEST_DIR" respectively with the paths to the source and destination directories. In this case, the source and destinations are both the folder for the MSD.

		find SRC_DIR -type f -print0 | xargs -0 mv -t DEST_DIR

	1.2) Now we have all of the tracks in a single folder.

2. Prepare the id-genre list for filtering.
	2.1) In genre_finder.py change the path on line 3 to open the MAGD .txt file with all ids and genres. Also change the genre in line 8 to your desired genre.
	2.2) Run genre_finder.py. Only tracks matching the desired genre will remain in the MAGD .txt file.
	2.3) In the MAGD .txt file, call find and replace, removing all instances of "    GENRE" from the file so that only track ids remain.

3. Filter the dataset
	3.1) In genre_filter.py change the path on line 3 to the path of the modified MAGD .txt file from part 2. Then change the path on line 7 to the path for the MSD sample dataset with 10000 samples (which is now a single directory with all tracks inside).
	3.2) Run genre_filter.py

Now the folder should contain only the songs matching the desired genre.
Repeat the steps above for other genres.
