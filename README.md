# Parasaurolophus: Music Recommender
CPEN 291 team project

Parasaurolophus, named after the dinosaur known for its unique sound, is designed to give music recommendations to users. The application takes an input wav file and uses a genre classifier’s prediction to recommend other music from the same genre. The application recognizes and recommends music from eight different music genres, namely: Blues,Country, Electronic, Folk, Jazz, Latin, Rock, and Rap music. The recommendation is also automatically copied to the user’s clipboard for convenience.

## Highlights

- Data Flow
    - Spectrogram extraction
    - Preparing model input
    - Interpreting model output

- Machine Learning
    - Model training and testing
    - Learned the framework Ensemble-Pytorch
        - Now, we can easily experiment with different kinds of machine learning ensembles to improve the accuracy of our genre classifier.
