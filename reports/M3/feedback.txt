- re data transfer, one thing you can consider is to use google cloud platform (gcp) instance. Once your instance is configured and your dataset is on the disk. Even if you stop the instance and restart later, you still have your dataset there. - What is your accuracy after final testing?
I also have some doubt on how you process your input to create the dataset. A related question will be what is the appropriate model for your task? I have quickly read the post you provide in your proposal. In that post, they are not doing audio classification directly with pretrained VGG. Instead, they are using that to extract the features, and then using SVM with those feature to do prediction. If you want to use a model to directly perform audio classification, you want a model that is suiable to process your data. In your case, audio data are 1D sequence, so it makes more sense if you use some sort of 1D convolution, dialated convolution, or like RNNs which works for sequence. VGG that works for image classification exploits 2D image pixel locality, but if your data are inheritly not like that, just blindly reshape and pad to satisfy the input shape of the network does not unleash its full power. I would suggest you to think about this carefully, and justify your choice in the next milestone.
