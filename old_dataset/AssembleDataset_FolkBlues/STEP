1. download data of track ids sorted by its genre from "http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/mir/msd/partitions/msd-MAGD-genreAssignment.cls"
    - This is the link that Matthew found
    - trackIDs.txt file contains this data
2. using filterGenre.py, separate track id of wanted genre (in my case folk and blues) and saved in file name folk.txt and blues.txt each.
3. Need data preprocessing by comparison with files in millionsongsubset
    - using geth5subset untar millionsonsubset downloaded in my local drive
    - remove overlapping trackIDs
    - using os.walk() function move through the folder to remove tracks that are not in the list folk.txt or blues.txt
    - save files to separate folder for folk and blues
